## So what is it?

solidMatter is a content repository and application framework written in PHP (and XSL if you will). The API is based on the JCR specification (not fully implemented and with some deviations), where the content nodes are extended by node-specific views and actions.

Development is still ongoing and it's clearly not reached true production stability yet, so currently there's no release version and virtually everything is WIP.

## Getting started

To get started, there are several places you should take a look at:

- [Git conventions](/documentation/git.md)

- Source conventions (TBD)

- [Documentation](/documentation) (this folder contains some documentation on solidMatter, including an installation guide - which is a little out of date unfortunately... :) Documentation is in general WIP, still much to do!)
  
- when installed, each module (node accessible via the content tree) has (or better will have...) a documentation view with API spec and other useful  module-specific information (again, big WIP)
  
more is to come...
